			<h2>Chaplin's first-ever tramp suit sold at auction</h2>
				
			<p>"The scruffy suit and hat used by Charlie Chaplin when he first appeared on film in his iconic role of a tramp was sold at auction in Britain on Wednesday. </p>

			<p>The black jacket, waistcoat, trousers and bowler hat, donned by the British-born film star in 1914, sold for just 3,565 pounds (5,175 euros, 6,530 dollars) at an auction in Plymouth, southwest England.</p>

			<p>It was seen worn by Chaplin for "Kid Auto Races at Venice", an 11-minute silent film which, while rarely viewed, has a secure place in film history thanks to Chaplin's debut as a tramp."</p>

			<h2>Charlie Chaplin turns 116 in a Kutch town</h2>
				
			<p>From the Sunday Express of India: "There's not much to see in Adipur. But today, this prosperous outpost in the Kutch desert, about 20 km from the Kandla port in Gujarat, commemorated an event most of us didn’t even know about: Charlie Chaplin’s 116th birthday.</p>
			<p>Late in the evening, 56-year-old Dr Ashok Aswani, president of the town’s club of Chaplin addicts, Charlie Circle, culminated four days of celebration with a cake-cutting ceremony for The Tramp, before settling in with neighbours and friends to watch Gold Rush for the nth time."</p>
